# Hello Guardians!

We need your help! Keep reading below to get more information on the Puzzle!

If you own the Beyond Light Collector's Edition:

1. Login to [bungie.net](https://bungie.net) and make sure you have redeemed the emblem code on your Europa Postcard
2. Visit [https://www.bungie.net/7/en/direct/analyze](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/direct/analyze) and enter code >!CHOOSE!<
3. [Submit the URL for the image you get back HERE!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd5cSSCP3DfchgvoYH773XJVRRpoqcIlgHwWSxnz730E94W_w/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.2125629261=CHOOSE) NO SCREENSHOTS PLEASE

# What we know so far:

Using the Splinter in the "Code" mode from the Beyond Light Collector's edition, we were able to get the code >!CHOOSE!< and the URL [https://bungie.net/analyze](https://bungie.net/analyze) from the first page of the Journal.

Going to this [URL](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/direct/analyze) you are presented with a rotating set of letters in an entry box. Attempting to submit an entry while not logged in asks you to log in. If you are logged in, but have not redeemed the unique Emblem code on the Europa postcard, you will get a message "TOKEN FAILURE // Redeem valid token". If you enter an incorrect phrase twice, you will need to wait about 5-10 minutes to submit a new phrase.

If you have redeemed the emblem code, and enter the correct phrase, you receive a countdown to 1 hour after reset on TWABday.

After that date, we know that users should receive a [message](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/539599286523133994/773777679912009758/unknown.png) that will include an image in the center.

Please, **DO NOT SUBMIT SCREENSHOTS** please read the notes below and on the [Submit form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd5cSSCP3DfchgvoYH773XJVRRpoqcIlgHwWSxnz730E94W_w/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.2125629261=CHOOSE)

# What we know about the puzzle so far:

* Not much before the Puzzle launches
* We will be getting a "Sequence Data Fragment"
* There will likely be semi-unique fragments for each CE user
* The end result will likely include the missing page [from the journal, and more](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/539599286523133994/773773681251057704/email_reponse.png)
